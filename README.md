# Hey, I'm Paulo ðŸ‘‹

- Builder of things with Vue.js, Nuxt, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, .NET, and Laravel.
- Most of my code lives behind closed doors (private repos), but my curiosity is always in the open.
- Fuelled by coffee, innovation, and a fascination for everything on four wheels.
- Youâ€™ll find me under PagansDev here and on LinkedIn (pagansdev).  
- Not a fan of the generic or the ordinary.

Let's make something cool.
